# automatic-attendance-system
The Automatic Attendance System is a Flutter-based mobile application that uses Face Recognition to mark student attendance in real-time. Instead of manual roll calls or paper registers, the system automatically detects and recognizes faces using a trained CNN model (FaceNet) and stores attendance data in Firebase.

The project is built with GetX state management, Firebase Authentication & Firestore, and supports multiple user roles including Admin, Teacher, and Student.
